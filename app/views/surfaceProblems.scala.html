                                DO label these as surface problems unless they are very minor; however, they are typically
                                only severity of 1 or 2 (unless extreme). Though they may not always directly impact the
                                accessibility of the sidewalk, they are “surface problems”. Without being monitored, they
                                could deteriorate further and cause accessibility problems in the future (<a href="https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/ped_bike/tools_solve/fhwasa13037/chap3.cfm">FHWA Guide for
                                Maintaining Pedestrian Facilities for Enhanced Safety 3.2.1</a>). Whether or not to label
                                these is difficult to assess. On the left, there are probably two surface problem labels
                                to be applied. On the right, it is very ambiguous, but there are two that should probably
                                be labeled, with further ones down possibly being labeled, though closer inspection would
                                be necessary.
