                            <p>
                                <strong>Background on obstacles.</strong> The ADA standards require a “clear floor or ground space” along
                                accessible pedestrian routes (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#pgfId-1006198">ADA 305</a>). This allows pedestrians to remain safely on the
                                sidewalk or crosswalk; clear paths are particularly important for pedestrians using
                                walkers or wheelchairs, since moving off the path to avoid an obstacle may be impossible
                                or more likely to cause imbalance, tripping, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What should I mark as an obstacle?</strong> Place an obstacle label on any object that is
                                directly on the path of a pedestrian route (meaning, do not place labels on objects
                                that do not block a path).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>How should I rate severity?</strong> Severity is higher for obstacles that cover more of the
                                path, have less room for navigating around them, or would cause pedestrians that avoid
                                them to put themselves into harm’s way (by going into traffic, going off the sidewalk,
                                etc). There are numerous examples below of permanent and temporary obstacles at a range
                                of severity ratings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Important note on label placement:</strong> Place labels at the base of obstacles. Placing at
                                higher positions may increase the likelihood that lat-lng estimation from the label
                                is inaccurate. Notice on the left below, how the label that is not placed at the base
                                of the tree has a lat-lng that it is very far from the sidewalk (seen in the mini map).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Important note on labeling a long stretch of construction:</strong> If a long stretch of sidewalk
                                is under construction (as in the example on the left below), place a temporary obstacle
                                label once at the beginning of the construction and once at the end, in the same manner
                                as in the Surface problems section.

                                Any permanent fixture that is placed in the direct path of pedestrian routes is a
                                permanent obstacle. This could also include extreme instances of overgrowth, as
                                in the fourth example. Poles that are located (even partially) within curb ramp flares
                                are an edge case, but you should mark them as obstacles.

                                            not walk in this area. The pole itself however, should be labelled as an obstacle,
                                            since pedestrians in wheelchairs may have difficulty navigating around it if they
                                            come up the curb ramp to the left.</figcaption>
