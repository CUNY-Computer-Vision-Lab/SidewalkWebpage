                We are looking for workers who can label the streets of Washington D.C. for us. We are particularly
                interested in identifying: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>accessibility features like Curb Ramps at intersections and the absence of them ("Missing Curb Ramp");</li>
                <li> problems such as degraded sidewalk ("Surface Problem"),
                    trash bins, light poles and others in the middle of a sidewalk ("Obstacle in Path") and absence of sidewalk
                    ("No Sidewalk").</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We have a fun interface (see the image) that allows you to walk <i>virtually</i>
                through the neighborhoods of DC in Google Street View to find and label. To complete this HIT, you need to do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Step 1</b>: Go through a short tutorial to learn how to use the interface. You only need to do it once for the HIT in this group.</li>
                <li><b>Step 2</b>: Complete a "mission" of walking and finding accessibility features and problems within a neighborhood.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3</b>: When you finish the "mission", we will show a complete mission dialog where you click the SUBMIT HIT button. Note, the submit button
                    shows up only when you complete the mission.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Please press the <b>ACCEPT HIT</b> button to get started.
            </p>
