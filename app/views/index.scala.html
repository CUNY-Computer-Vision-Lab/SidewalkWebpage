            We are looking for workers who can label streets of Washington D.C. for us. We have a fun interface for you that allows
            you to walk <i>virtually</i> through the neighborhoods of DC in Google Street View. To complete this
            HIT, you need to do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Go through a short tutorial to learn about the interface. You only need to do it once for the HIT in this group.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Complete a "mission" of walking a certain distance and find accessibility features and problems within a neighborhood.</li>
            <li>Step 3: When you finish the "mission", we will show a complete mission dialog where you click the SUBMIT HIT button. Note, the submit button
                shows up only when you complete the mission.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please press the ACCEPT HIT button to get started.
