                                marks a missing curb ramp because there is a crosswalk but no curb ramp
                                and the existing ramp is facing the other street. This would get a severity
                                rating ~3 because there is another curb ramp on that corner that could be
                                used instead, though pedestrians are moderately lead into traffic due to

                                If a <strong>curb ramp</strong> has surface problems, increase the severity
                                of the curb ramp, but <strong>DO NOT</strong> place a <strong>surface problem</strong>
                                label. The rationale is that cracks and such in a curb ramp are one of the many
                                factors that can make a curb ramp less passable, so there should be a higher curb
                                ramp severity. But we don’t need to double-count the issue by also labeling it as
                                a surface problem.
                            </p>

                                <strong>NOTE:</strong> This differs from how we deal with obstacles on curb ramps.
                                We actually take the opposite approach with obstacles. The idea is that a bad curb
                                ramp is just a bad curb ramp, while an obstacle is something external to the curb
                                ramp. This is honestly pretty confusing and could be clarified in the future.

                                Severity ratings should be equivalent to how they are done for surface problems,
                                described in the sections on Sidewalk Cracks and Grass between sidewalk blocks.
                                However, here are a few examples.

                                If a <strong>curb ramp</strong> appears narrow, then it should have
                                severity > 1 (the ADA requires a width of at least 3 ft - ADA 403.5.1).
                                Since we have no measuring tools, use your best judgement. For example,
                                the ramp on the right would get a severity of 3 because it is a bit narrower
                                than 3ft, and is also missing a friction strip.

                                If a <strong>curb ramp</strong> has a large amount of dead leaves
                                (or other debris) on it, the severity should be > 1 (FHWA Guide for
                                Maintaining Pedestrian Facilities for Enhanced Safety 3.2.2), but
                                would not result in severity > 3 if the debris is the only issue.
                                This could cause slippery conditions or could slow down wheelchair
                                users in extreme cases. Do not place a surface problem label along
                                with the curb ramp label. Only place a surface problem label on the
                                sidewalk (not on curb ramp).

                                If a <strong>curb ramp</strong> does not have enough landing space at the top
                                of the ramp for making turns, the severity should be > 1 (the ADA requires at
                                least 3ft - ADA 406.4). In situations of insufficient landing space, severity
                                also depends on presence and steepness of the angled sides of a ramp (called flares),
                                so also consult the section on Steep flares. The example on the right gets a severity
                                of ~2, since there is not enough landing space, but the flares are not too steep.
                                The ramps on the 2nd row would get a severity of ~3, since they both have no landing
                                space at all, while again having flared sides that are not steep.

                                If a <strong>curb ramp</strong> has overly steep angled sides (called flares),
                                severity should be > 1, but would not result in severity > 3 if the flares are
                                the only issue. Steep flares are particularly problematic when there is Insufficient
                                landing space at the top of the ramp, since wheelchair users may need to use the
                                flares to make turns and could lose their balance. However, steep flares are not
                                an issue when pedestrians are not meant to be using them anyway, as in the rightmost
                                illustration.

                                The leftmost image has very steep sides, is far too narrow, and also is missing a
                                friction strip, so it would get a severity of ~3. The middle image has insufficient
                                landing space, but it’s flares are not steep, so the severity is only ~2. The
                                illustration on the right does not need flares, since the sides of the ramp are
                                lined by grass (meaning pedestrians are not meant to use it), so the severity would
                                probably be 1.

                                If a <strong>curb ramp</strong> has a steep counter slope (the slope opposite to

                                should be > 1 (the ADA requires counter slopes to be at no more than a ~3 degree
                                angle - ADA 406.2). You only need to consider obvious cases of steep counter slopes,
                                as we have no angle measurement tools. The illustration on the left would get a
