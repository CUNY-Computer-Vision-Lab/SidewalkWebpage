                                This codebook is meant to be used as a guide for how to use Project Sidewalk to label accessibility
                                problems in a standardized way, that is grounded in a close reading of the specifications of the
                                Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and related documents. The codebook contains instructions
                                for where to place labels, how to rate severity of the labels, along with rationale for those
                                decisions (including ADA citations where appropriate).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Important note on which pano to label from: </strong>Always label an issue/feature from the
                                place where it is most visible or closest (being closer to the thing you label makes the lat-lng
                                of the label more accurate).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Important note on label placement: </strong>Place labels at the center of curb ramp or surface
                                problem, and at the base of an obstacle. This is both to standardize the placement and, in the case
                                of obstacles, making sure that the location is accurate. Placing a label higher than the base of an
                                obstacle could give a very inaccurate lat-lng. The left and center images show correct placement, and
                                the right image shows incorrect placement.

                                <strong>Important note on temporal change between adjacent panos: </strong>If you take a step and things
                                change (temporary obstacles like construction are removed, a curb ramp has been added or improved, etc),
                                then label each panorama appropriately. When doing this, also click the feedback button and write a
                                message saying what changed between the 2 panos. You do not need to label the same problem from multiple
                                panoramas if nothing changes.

                                The protocol for labeling no sidewalk for ground truth collection is as follows: place
                                one label where the sidewalk ends, and one label where the sidewalk begins again. If
                                an entire block or more has no sidewalk, then place a label at the beginning and end
                                of each street. (and if two intersecting streets both have no sidewalk, then a single
                                label can be placed on the corner)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do not place No Sidewalk labels in narrow side streets or alleys.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you reach a 3-way intersection that has no sidewalk DO place a no sidewalk label
                                in the center of the opposite street where a sidewalk would be.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                DO NOT place no sidewalk labels on a median that separates the two directions of traffic
                                (unless the median has a sidewalk that abruptly ends).
                            </p>

                                If you actually canâ€™t see something at all, then you can place the occlusion label.
                                This should rarely be used; only apply this label when a sidewalk/ramp/etc cannot be
                                viewed from any angle due to obstructions, such as cars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another rare case of occlusion (though not that uncommon in Monumental Core) is when a
                                long stretch of sidewalk is totally blocked from view by a short wall between the road
                                and sidewalk. Label this using the same technique as for extended no sidewalk.
